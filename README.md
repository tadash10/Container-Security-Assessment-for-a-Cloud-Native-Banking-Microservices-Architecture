# Container-Security-Assessment-for-a-Cloud-Native-Banking-Microservices-Architecture
Objective:
The objective of this container security assessment is to thoroughly evaluate the security of Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration deployed in a cloud-native microservices architecture that supports a banking application. The assessment aims to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security weaknesses that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive banking data and multiple services.


  Review Dockerfile Best Practices:
        Evaluate Dockerfiles used to build container images for adherence to best practices such as minimizing layers, using official base images from trusted sources, and reducing the attack surface.
        Check for hardcoded credentials, unnecessary packages, and open ports within Docker images.

    Container Image Vulnerability Assessment:
        Utilize vulnerability scanning tools like Clair or Trivy to analyze container images for known vulnerabilities and insecure configurations.
        Classify vulnerabilities based on severity levels and their potential impact on the banking application.

    Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (PSP):
        Assess the existing Pod Security Policies (PSP) to ensure that containers are running with the minimum necessary privileges and are isolated from each other.
        Review PSP settings for capabilities, SELinux/AppArmor profiles, host namespace sharing, and volume permissions.

    Network Policies:
        Examine Kubernetes Network Policies to verify that communication between microservices is restricted based on the principle of least privilege.
        Ensure that sensitive banking services are adequately protected from unauthorized access and that egress traffic is restricted as needed.

    Secrets Management:
        Evaluate the management of sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys within Kubernetes Secrets.
        Verify that Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit, and assess access controls to ensure only authorized services and users can access them.

Deliverables:

    Container Security Assessment Report:
        Executive Summary: Overview of the assessment objectives, methodology, and key findings.
        Findings and Risk Ratings: Detailed findings categorized by severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) with corresponding risk ratings based on the impact and likelihood of exploitation.
        Recommendations: Actionable recommendations for improving container and Kubernetes security, including prioritized steps to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and enhance overall security posture.
        Conclusion: Summary of the assessment outcomes and next steps for ongoing security enhancements.


        Step-by-Step Guide for Achieving the Objective

Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step guide tailored for pentesting AWS environments, Docker containers, and Kubernetes orchestration supporting a banking application:
Preparation

    Understand AWS Architecture:
        Review AWS architecture diagrams, including VPC configurations, subnet layouts, and security group rules.
        Identify AWS services used, such as EC2 instances, ECS or EKS clusters, RDS databases, S3 buckets, IAM roles, and Lambda functions.

    Set Up Testing Environment:
        Deploy a test environment mimicking the production setup on AWS using CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CLI scripts.
        Configure Docker and Kubernetes within AWS, ensuring proper networking and security settings.

Assessment Execution

    AWS Service Enumeration:
        Use AWS CLI or SDKs to enumerate AWS services and configurations.
        Identify exposed APIs, IAM roles, permissions, and sensitive data stored in AWS services.

    Container Image Analysis:
        Analyze Docker images used in Kubernetes deployments for vulnerabilities using tools like Anchore Engine, Clair, or Trivy.
        Check Dockerfile instructions for security best practices, such as image layering, non-root users, and minimal software packages.

    Kubernetes Security Review:
        Inspect Kubernetes YAML files (deployments, services, ingress controllers) for security configurations, including RBAC roles, network policies, and pod security contexts.
        Validate Kubernetes secrets management practices and encryption mechanisms.

    Network and Traffic Analysis:
        Use tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic between Kubernetes pods and AWS services.
        Verify TLS encryption and mutual authentication for inter-service communication.

    Exploitation and Vulnerability Assessment:
        Conduct manual penetration testing against exposed APIs, web applications, and backend services.
        Use automated scanners like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to identify common web application vulnerabilities.
        Exploit misconfigurations in Docker containers, Kubernetes pods, or AWS IAM permissions to demonstrate impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability of banking data.

Reporting and Mitigation

    Documentation:
        Document findings in a detailed report, including vulnerabilities discovered, their risk ratings (based on CVSS scores), and potential business impact.
        Provide clear steps to reproduce findings and recommend mitigations specific to AWS services and Kubernetes configurations.

    Prioritization and Remediation:
        Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and likelihood of exploitation, considering the impact on sensitive banking data.
        Work with development and operations teams to implement fixes, configure security controls, and apply patches to Docker images and Kubernetes deployments.

    Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:
        Recommend continuous monitoring practices using AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and third-party tools to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
        Advocate for ongoing security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning to maintain a robust security posture.

Conclusion:
This container security assessment will provide a comprehensive view of the current security posture of the Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration supporting the cloud-native microservices architecture for the banking application. By addressing vulnerabilities and implementing recommended security improvements, the organization can strengthen its defenses against potential cyber threats and ensure the secure delivery of banking services to its customers.
