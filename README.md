# Container-Security-Assessment-for-a-Cloud-Native-Banking-Microservices-Architecture
Objective:
The objective of this container security assessment is to thoroughly evaluate the security of Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration deployed in a cloud-native microservices architecture that supports a banking application. The assessment aims to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security weaknesses that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of sensitive banking data and services.

Tasks:

    Review Dockerfile Best Practices:
        Evaluate Dockerfiles used to build container images for adherence to best practices such as minimizing layers, using official base images from trusted sources, and reducing the attack surface.
        Check for hardcoded credentials, unnecessary packages, and open ports within Docker images.

    Container Image Vulnerability Assessment:
        Utilize vulnerability scanning tools like Clair or Trivy to analyze container images for known vulnerabilities and insecure configurations.
        Classify vulnerabilities based on severity levels and their potential impact on the banking application.

    Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (PSP):
        Assess the existing Pod Security Policies (PSP) to ensure that containers are running with the minimum necessary privileges and are isolated from each other.
        Review PSP settings for capabilities, SELinux/AppArmor profiles, host namespace sharing, and volume permissions.

    Network Policies:
        Examine Kubernetes Network Policies to verify that communication between microservices is restricted based on the principle of least privilege.
        Ensure that sensitive banking services are adequately protected from unauthorized access and that egress traffic is restricted as needed.

    Secrets Management:
        Evaluate the management of sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys within Kubernetes Secrets.
        Verify that Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit, and assess access controls to ensure only authorized services and users can access them.

Deliverables:

    Container Security Assessment Report:
        Executive Summary: Overview of the assessment objectives, methodology, and key findings.
        Findings and Risk Ratings: Detailed findings categorized by severity (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) with corresponding risk ratings based on the impact and likelihood of exploitation.
        Recommendations: Actionable recommendations for improving container and Kubernetes security, including prioritized steps to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and enhance overall security posture.
        Conclusion: Summary of the assessment outcomes and next steps for ongoing security enhancements.

Conclusion:
This container security assessment will provide a comprehensive view of the current security posture of the Docker containers and Kubernetes orchestration supporting the cloud-native microservices architecture for the banking application. By addressing vulnerabilities and implementing recommended security improvements, the organization can strengthen its defenses against potential cyber threats and ensure the secure delivery of banking services to its customers.
